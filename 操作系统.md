For round robin, during the first 10 minutes each job gets 1/5 of the CPU. At the end of 10 minutes, C finishes. During the next 8 minutes, each job gets 1/4 of the CPU, after which time D finishes. Then each of the three remaining jobs gets 1/3 of the CPU for 6 minutes, until B finishes, and so on. The finishing times for the five jobs are 10, 18, 24, 28, and 30, for an average of 22 minutes. For priority scheduling, B is run first. After 6 minutes it is finished. The other jobs finish at 14, 24, 26, and 30, for an average of 18.8 minutes. If the jobs run in the order A through E, they finish at 10, 16, 18, 22, and 30, for an average of 19.2 minutes. Finally, shortest job first yields finishing times of 2, 6, 12, 20, and 30, for an average of 14 minutes.
